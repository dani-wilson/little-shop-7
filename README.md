<h3 align="center">Description</h3>

<p align="center">
  "Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.
</p></br>

## Summary of Work Completed
This project was originally designed with 6 specific categories:
<li>Merchant Dashboard</li> 
<li>Merchant Items</li> 
<li>Merchant Invoices</li> 
<li>Admin Dashboard</li> 
<li>Admin Merchants</li> 
<li>Admin Invoices</li> 
</br>
with an additional section for the familiarization of APIs, containing four user stories.</br></br>
Ample time was spent on the initial database design & setup, as well as the Render deployment. Then, the first six sections were divided up between each group member, and 2/4 of the API stories were completed as a team.</br>

## Ideas for Potential Refactor
- Making a single, cohesive test-data block that could be used across the testing suite
- Adding more sad path testing and exploring more edge cases
- More consistent styling across all page views
- Agreeing upon convention to do with 'describe' and 'it' blocks in rspec testing
- Making ActiveRecord queries more compact wherever possible
